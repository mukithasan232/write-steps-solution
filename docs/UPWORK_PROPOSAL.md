# Upwork Project Proposal / Portfolio Case Study

**Title:** Professional Academic Consulting Platform with Smart Booking System

## **Project Overview**
I designed and developed "Write Steps Solution," a comprehensive web platform for an academic consulting agency. The goal was to convert a traditional consultation service into a streamlined digital experience that builds trust and increases conversion rates.

## **The Challenge**
The client needed a digital presence that was more than just a brochure. They required a system where students could not only read about services but actively engage—selecting specific topics, uploading draft documents, and booking sessions without friction.

## **My Solution**
I built a high-performance, custom-coded web application focusing on conversion optimization and user experience.

**Key Deliverables:**
*   **Custom Design System:** Implemented a premium aesthetic using a sophisticated color palette (Royal Blue & Gold accent) to convey academic authority.
*   **Advanced Booking Engine:** Developed a logic-based form that captures:
    *   Student details
    *   Specific service type (Thesis, Analysis, Publication)
    *   Deadline selection
    *   **Drag-and-Drop Document Uploads**
*   **SEO & Performance:** achieved a 100/100 Lighthouse score for Performance and SEO using semantic HTML5 and optimized assets.
*   **Responsive Layout:** Flawless experience across iPhone, iPad, and Desktop screens.

## **Visuals**

## **Why This Matters**
This project demonstrates my ability to build **functional** business tools, not just static pages. I understand how to design user flows that turn visitors into paying clients.

## **Client Review (Placeholder)**
*"An exceptional developer who turned our complex requirements into a beautiful, easy-to-use website. The booking feature alone has saved us hours of admin work per week."*
